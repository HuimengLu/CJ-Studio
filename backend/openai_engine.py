"""OpenAI gpt-image-1 background/shadow generation (Testing 2 path).

Given a product photo, ask the model to redraw it on a solid white background
with a realistic studio shadow. The white
plate is later multiply-blended onto the CJ backdrop (pipeline.compose_testing2),
so no alpha is needed — pure white multiplies to identity and only the shadow
darkens the backdrop.

Uses the image *edit* endpoint (edits the uploaded photo rather than generating
from scratch), with input_fidelity=high to preserve the product's real detail.

Auth: OPENAI_API_KEY from the environment or a repo-root .env. The key value
never appears in code. Note: gpt-image-1 requires a verified OpenAI org.
